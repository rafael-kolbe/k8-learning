# Kubernetes Learning Process
    This repo contains my thought process while learning kubernetes.
    It's a way for me to register everything in case I forget something.
    If you found this repo somehow, Hi! I hope it's useful for you too.

### Disclaimer
    My mother language is brazilian portuguese, but I chose to write this in english for practice.
    Excuse my grammar mistakes if you were to read this.
